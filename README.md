### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! My name is Chris Yoon, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Computer Science! I am particularly passionate about software systems. 

Previously, I was at Riot Games as a Software Engineer Intern, building tools around their monitoring systems for their live game services. 

I will be a Software Engineer Intern at Virtu Financial (a high frequency trading firm) during Summer 2023, and then at Palantir during Fall 2023.
