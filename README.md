### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! My name is Chris Yoon, and I am a 2nd year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Computer Science! I am particularly passionate about **distributed systems** and **machine learning systems & infrastructure.** 

I also do research at Columbia University, where Iâ€™ve been building software systems for debugging behavior of data-points in large-scale ML training.

Here are some courses I've taken while at Columbia:
| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operating Systems | Database Systems | Parallel Functional Programming  |
| Artificial Intelligence | Real Analysis | Abstract Algebra I & II |
| Topology Reading | Number Theory and Cryptography | |

Here's a rough timeline of my experiences, in reverse chronological order:
- _2023 May - Aug_     : Joining **Virtu Financial** as a _Software Engineer Intern_
- _2022 May - Aug_     : _Software Engineer Intern_ at **Riot Games**, Live Operations Engineering / Incident Management Team.
- _2021 Sep - Present_  : _Undergrad Researcher_ under Prof. Junfeng Yang **(Columbia)**, working on **debugging tools for Tensorflow 2**.
- _2021 May - Nov_      : _Software Enginner_ at **Faikerz** (based in South Korea), worked on **counterfeit product detection and clustering** for E-commerce sites.
- _2021 Jan - Aug_      : _Undergrad Researcher_ at the **AlQuraishi Lab (Columbia)**, worked on **geometric deep learning for protein structure informatics**.
- _2020 May - Aug_     : _ML Engineer Intern_ at **Medipixel** (based in South Korea), worked on **distributed reinforcement learning**.
- _2019 May - Aug_     : _Student Researcher_ at **Stony Brook University** (Under Prof. Ji Liu and the Simons Foundation), worked on **distributed reinforcement learning**.
