### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! My name is Chris Yoon, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Computer Science! I am particularly passionate about software systems. 

Previously, I was at Riot Games as a Software Engineer Intern, building tools around their monitoring systems for live game services. 

Next summer, I will be joining Virtu Financial (a high frequency trading firm) as a Software Engineer Intern; after that, I will be joining Palantir in their New York office for Fall '23!
