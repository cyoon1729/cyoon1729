### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a second year undergraduate at Columbia University, where I plan to pursue a B.A. in Computer Science! I started college as a prospective math major, and completed coursework in abstract algebra, real analysis, topology, and number theory. However, my experiences in software/ML engineering sealed my fate as a CS student! *I am particularly passionate about **software systems**, with a bent towards **distributed architecure/computing** and **ML infrastructure**.*

Here's a rough timeline of my experiences, in reverse chronological order:
- 2022 May - Aug     : Software Engineer Intern at **Riot Games**, Live Operations Engineering Team.
- 2021 Sep - Present : Undergrad Researcher at **Columbia University** (under Prof. Junfeng Yang), working on **debugging tools for Tensorflow 2**.
- 2021 May - Nov     : Software Enginner at **Faikerz** (based in South Korea), worked on **counterfeit product detection and clustering** for E-commerce sites.
- 2021 Jan - Aug     : Undergrad Researcher at **Columbia Universtiy** (at the AlQuraishi Lab), worked on **geometric deep learning on protein structure**.
- 2020 May - Aug     : ML Engineer Intern at **Medipixel** (based in South Korea), worked on **distributed reinforcement learning**.
- 2019 May - Aug     : Student Researcer at **Stony Brook University** (Under Prof. Ji Liu and the Simons Foundation), worked on **distributed reinforcement learning**.
